ISSUES (pointed out by Nakul): 

1. King's mgr is not visible - done
2. Total compensation is not correctly calculated (due to department changes e.g. SCOTT)
3. Testing should not be redundant for database connection checking
4. Testing should contain checking NULL values of "king" and SCOTT entries.
